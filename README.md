# 🔐 Encryption & Decryption Project

This project is written in C++ and includes simple encryption and decryption algorithms designed to enhance data security. It was developed as part of a university project by **Mohammadreza**.

## ⚡ Quick Overview
A basic yet powerful encryption and decryption tool that uses single and multi-key algorithms to secure data. Perfect for understanding fundamental cryptographic concepts.

## 📜 Features
- **Single-Key Encryption:** Uses a simple key for data encryption.
- **Multi-Key Encryption:** Utilizes a string of characters as a key for enhanced security.
- **Data Decryption:** Ability to decrypt encrypted data using the same key.
- **Console Customization:** Changes text colors for better readability.
- **Data Storage:** Saves encrypted data to a text file.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Run the project in Visual Studio or any C++ compiler.
2. The program provides a menu where you can select the following options:
   - [1] **Encryption**
   - [2] **Decryption**
   - [3] **Multi Encryption**
   - [4] **Multi Decryption**
   - [0] **Return to Main Menu**

## 🔑 Encryption Algorithms
- **XOR Algorithm:** Combines data with the key to provide basic security.
- **Modular Operations:** Limits the generated characters within a displayable range.

## 📂 File Structure
- `encryption.txt`: Output file that stores the encrypted data.
- `CryptoCore.cpp`: Main source code file of the program.
